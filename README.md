## Hello World! This is Muminjon
I have made this simple but valuable Animation demo using the [Delphi FireMonkey](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi).

What I have used? 

 - The TFloatAnimation component which gives you so many cool things that you can use for creating stunning animations without other resources.
 - Tab transition which lots of  new developer donâ€™t use it. It is very simple, you just need to learn the TActionList component.
 - The TRectangle component. Why TRectangle not just TLayout or TPanel. Because the TRectangle is much more easy to use.
 - The System.Threading module that you can use it for creating multi-threaded applications.
 
## Also there are some additional animations for your Delphi FireMonkey Project 

Here you can see the demonstration of the Additional Animations: [src](https://photos.app.goo.gl/yDSLi9T9CxLbYXbj8)
